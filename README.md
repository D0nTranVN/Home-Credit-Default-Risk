# KNN-on-Home-Credit-Default-Risk
My goal in this project is about predicting payment behavior of clients from application. I used my financial knowledge to solve the missing values of the observations. Then use a combination of KNN (Local Outlier Factors) algorithm and the legal framework on consumer credit in Vietnam to eliminate outliers. Finally, I use KNeighborsClassifier to predict payment behavior of clients from application. 
AUC score: ~0.76
